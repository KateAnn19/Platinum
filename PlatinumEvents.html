	<h3> History</h3>
<p1> 
In 2014 Platinum Event Staffing was created as a way to provide exceptional service and commitment to our clients’ needs. With 16 years in the food service industry and 10 years in management, Ashley Hager the owner/operator started growing Platinum Event Staffing to provide the type of service the Tulsa area was needing. Ashley provides higher quality staff members that have experience in fine dining, banquets, catering, bartending, and general service needs.

We are insured and operate out of Broken Arrow, OK. The following are venues, caterers, and event planners we have worked closely with over the past 2 yrs.
